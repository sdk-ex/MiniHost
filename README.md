 This is the server that I use to perform my exploits. Rather, specifically,    
 its a version that I am designing myself. I cannot and will not make any      
 kind of agreement with you. You may get yourself in trouble using this, I take
 no responsibity for any use of this product outside the scope of the law.     

 I operate under safe-harbor provisions, and/or with explicit permission.     
 The use of this product does not fall within the scope of my own responsibilty     
 in any way. In fact, ***Don't use it!***

 Not only was are my licensing terms very intentionally limiting, but this is a
 fun and simple project that I urge you to attempt on your own.
